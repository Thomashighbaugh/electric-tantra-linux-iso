## Work In Progress

This repository houses all the files necessary to generate an Arch Linux iso file from the profile contained within the iso directory. To do this run the following:
```bash
# git clone https://github.com/Thomashighbaugh/electric-tantra-linux-iso
# cd electric-tantra-linux-iso
# mkarchiso -v -w /tmp/mkarchiso-tmp ./iso 
```
